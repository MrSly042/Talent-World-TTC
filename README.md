# Talent-World-TTC
An automation app, made with Python, Google Cloud Console, & google Cloud APIs automatically detects an email which notifies of newly posted shifts at Talent World. It then downloads the worksheet, which contains the latest postings, checks if any shifts match preset selections, and writes an email response specifying the choice.
